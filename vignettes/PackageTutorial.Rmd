# An Introduction to my R package
### A bit smoller

My R package is very *useful* and it does **three** things.

We can go onto a new line by leaving one line of space between texts.

```{r}
sum(1,4)
```

## Installation Instructions

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
install.packages("phytools")
# But if you include text in a code chunk it must be commented out.
```


We can include text anywhere within the document.
