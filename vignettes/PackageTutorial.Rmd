# An Introduction to my R package
### A bit smoller

My R package is very *useful* and it does **three** things.

We can go onto a new line by leaving one line of space between texts.

```{r}
sum(1,4)
```

## Installation Instructions

Step 1 is to download the water quality data needed to use this package.
```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
download.file(url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gaelyngros/Gros_pkg/master/data/ac_field_data.csv", destfile = filepath) 
```              

Step 2 is to download the packages needed for the package. :) 
```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("leaflet")
# But if you include text in a code chunk it must be commented out.
```


We can include text anywhere within the document.
